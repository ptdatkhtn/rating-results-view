The value of degrees is constantly decreasing in the West, especially in the US, and more emphasis is given to different kinds of certificates and practically proven qualifications.</p>",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>A report on the future of work by the World Economic Forum underlines that anticipating and managing expertise needs are becoming increasingly important. They estimate that up to 65 % of children starting their school this year will end up working in occupations and tasks that do not yet exist today. This rapid change is also showcased by the fact that many of the most hyped contemporary occupations and fields have been invented within the last ten years.</p><p>The core of many academic degrees is rapidly changing. For example, by the time of graduation, up to 50 % of information received in the first year of a four-year technical degree may have become outdated. The report also states that up to a third of the core competencies linked to most occupations may change by the year 2020. Artificial intelligence and robotics developments may completely replace some human occupations and to drastically alter tasks and jobs in practically all fields and industries within the next few decades.</p><p>The skills required for many professions have changed in a relatively short time and the pace of change is likely to quicken. Hence personal characteristics, practical experience, certificates and genuine, proven qualifications seem far more essential for employees than mere academic degrees.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Rapid changes in professions and industries mean that degrees no longer match the skill requirements of the work markets and cannot ensure a successful professional career or even full-time employment.</p><p>Degree curricula need to be radically renewed increasingly often, if the goal of degrees is to meet the needs of societies, organisations, and individuals. If supply and demand do not genuinely meet, completing outdated and unnecessary degrees may prove expensive for societies and individuals alike. This development does not merely deal with renewing education of future generations: it is of paramount importance to invest into the further education and re-education of existing workforce.</p><p>In case degrees are replaced by certificates and practically proven qualifications, what happens to educational institutions, the teaching profession, university research, and academic general knowledge? Can we expect more nepotism in recruitment or limited social mobility? What kind of boundaries between social classes disappear and which ones strengthen?</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”The Future of Jobs”.

            "summary": "Bionics is slowly entering the sphere of construction techniques. In the future, it is possible that construction components or even whole buildings are no longer built, but planted and grown and linked to the surrounding ecosystem. The growth and renewal of such “living” buildings can be guided e.g. with moulds, casts, and fertilisers.\n",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>The field studying replacement of physical materials, such as concrete, plastic, polystyrene, or glass with biomaterials is called bionics, biomimetics, or biomimicry, and it forms a very promising field for the future. Bionics gives us a reason to believe in self-maintaining buildings or even cities that grow, wholly or in part, autonomously from biomaterials. Self-maintaining and self-growing buildings are, in a way, alive and thus constantly changing.</p><p>The field has seen several breakthroughs and some inventions are already in use. For instance, a Finnish company has entered the market with a bacterial substance for concrete surfaces that hibernates as long as the surface remains intact but awakes if the surface is cracked and moisture enters the structure. If this is the case, the bacteria produce a chalk-like substance that fills the cracks and blocks further moisture from entering the structure. In the long run, however, the potential of bionics reaches far greater heights. As Rachel Armstrong demonstrates in the video link below, limestone can be guided to grow, for example, a new foundation for the city of Venice or in the shape of walls for new buildings.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>\"Self healing material\".

It is very well possible that some big actors will soon be able to create alliances and umbrella-like business ecosystems, which, for a monthly fee tied to the rent, offer genuinely many-sided deals.&nbsp;Besides everyday consumer goods, these deals could include travel, mobility, banking, insurance, healthcare, and housing services. Business alliances dedicated to a single ecosystem could bundle up all the different kinds of services and offer, for example, differently priced leasing packages for different kinds of customers. Say, a bronze level service package might include a low-priced rental car and a small flat, whereas a platinum level service with a far higher price tag could allow the customer to choose from a variety of luxurious options.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Sarwant Singh, ”Can Vehicle Leasing Stay On Track As Subscription Models Hit The Fast Lane?”.

The revolution is driven, amongst other things, by digitalisation, robotics, automation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of everything, biotechnology, and big data.

            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>The next industrial revolution has been called by some the 2nd industrial revolution, while others have named it Industrial revolution 4.0 (or industry 4.0). Describing this development as the second phase puts focus on the great impacts of this change. The next era of human societies is characterised by digitalisation, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of everything with its interlinked objects and devices. Key words include intelligence as well as smart, interconnected devices, people, and robotics. The number of breakthroughs is huge and the speed of change is exponential. This means that the change seems even more drastic than in previous industrial revolutions.</p><p>Industrial revolutions can be described as follows:</p><ul><li>1.0: steam powered production</li><li>2.0: electric devices, internal combustion engine, and assembly line</li><li>3.0: personal computing and automation</li><li>4.0: interconnected devices and machine-machine communication</li></ul><p>The vocabulary of the fourth industrial revolution include smart cities, smart buildings, intelligent workplaces, automated factories, and self-repairing devices. Our built environment will contain billions of tiny sensors that create and disseminate data and information and help us in our daily tasks. Decision-making can be based on real-time data. Platforms, sharing economy, mass customisation, and cloud services are the norm, as are different kinds of disruption (consider Uber) and the circular economy. The new industrial revolution is also characterised by continuous networked debate, AI and robot co-workers, autonomous vehicles and flying devices, platforms, and synthetic biology, to name a few things. What we are dealing with is first and foremost a combination of innovation and breakthroughs, whose final impacts are difficult or impossible to anticipate. The fourth industrial revolution does not merely change what we do and how, but it also changes us as a species.</p><h2>Recent Developments</h2><p>California-based Drive.ai has successfully tested a driverless car on a public road in Texas. For its part, Starsky Robotics has announced that its driverless truck drove seven miles of a public, if however rural, road without problems. Even though self-driving cars are believed to be several years away, technology may develop considerably faster than expected thanks to successes like those mentioned above.</p><p>Splunk Industrial Asset Intelligence (IAI), created by the US-based Splunk Enterprise, is a real-time analytics solution aimed at the oil and gas industry, logistics, and the energy business. Splunk IAI continually monitors the data delivered by the industrial IoT, helping the customers to ensure that the systems are working at full capacity. The use of data, made central by the fourth industrial revolution, is bringing more and more tools like the Splunk IAI to the market, and integrating these tools to production will become an area of fierce competition.</p><p>There is an attempt to create a sense of smell for an AI so that it can detect various diseases from human breath. Even though the ability to analyse small airborne particles has existed for a long time, the introduction of the AI makes the analysis both quicker and more accurate, making it useful in examining various substances.</p><p>Claroty focuses on creating cybersecurity solutions for industrial digital infrastructure. As the industrial IoT becomes more widespread, and the cybersecurity challenges increase, the demand for companies like Claroty is going to grow. Claroty was able to acquire funding of 60 million dollars from investors indicating the growing interest the field attracts.</p><p>The Korean firm Jenax is developing a flexible battery. The shape of the battery is customisable, making its use possible, e.g., in wearable technology and sensors. The flexibility of the battery makes the work of designers easier as they are released from some of the limitations of conventional batteries.</p><h2>Forecasts</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/mobility-report/internet-of-things-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Ericsson:</a>&nbsp;\"The number of IoT-devices is forecasted to reach 1.5 billion by 2022.\"</li><li><a href=\"https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/ai-in-transportation-market\" target=\"_blank\">P&amp;S Market Research:</a>&nbsp;\"The global AI in the transportation market is predicted to reach $3.5 billion by 2023, registering a CAGR of 16.5% during 2018–2023.\"</li><li><a href=\"https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/industrial-cyber-security-market-4408\" target=\"_blank\">Market Research Future:</a>&nbsp;\"The industrial cyber security market is forecasted to reach c. $24.41 billion by the end of 2023, with 10,97% CAGR.\"</li></ul><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Andrew J.

Before nation states, areas were controlled and managed by local counts and kings and even earlier by tribal chiefs. The first blooming cities were often independent and where ancient Greek cities were concerned, they were even democratically led.</p><p>Today there are ca. 130 cities in China alone with more than a million inhabitants. The number of actual megacities may very well exceed 40. The combined economic significance of these cities has been estimated to be reasonably higher than the economic importance of all the world’s 200+ nations combined if the megacities’ weight is not included in the calculations. Taken into consideration that urbanisation is an on-going and accelerating process, we can estimate that over 70 % of the world population lives in megacities by 2050. Furthermore, the value systems of people living in large metropoles often significantly differ from those of the rest of the population, and thus it is relatively reasonable to expect declarations of independence from metropoles at some point in time.</p><p>London is the first megacity where demands of independence have been voiced out loud.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>\"London&nbsp;independence\".

Changes in teaching methodology are also strongly linked to technological development, which essentially changes future competence requirements as well as alters learning tools, methods, and environments.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>As information production becomes automated and as repetitive work is conducted by robots, many professions will be redefined or cease to exist. In the future, the role of humans is expected to be particularly essential in tasks requiring creativity, ingenuity, or flexibility. Many current teaching and assessment models are criticised for encouraging mere memorisation, search for a single correct answer, and avoidance of mistakes.</p><p>This is about to change, since new teaching methods aim to support learning increasingly strongly through experimentation and practical tasks. One essential issue is that different forms of intelligence and talent are accepted as such and more individualised learning paths and methods are approved. The key words of new teaching methods include, amongst others, phenomenon-based learning, active engagement, peer learning, telelearning, and self-learning.</p><p>Besides future competence needs, technology advancement also has a significant impact on tools and equipment that can be utilised in further developing teaching or professional skills in the future. A variety of technologies enable multiple simultaneous means of presence: physical, virtual, social, and mobile. Increasing smartness and mediation of our built environment also bring about new opportunities to widen and develop learning environments.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Pressures to renew public and private education systems are building up. The roles of teachers and classrooms will drastically change as new teaching methods are adopted. Teacher will more and more become sparring partners, directors, and builders of interest. Learning takes place regardless of location or time, and increasing amounts of courses are available for all interested parties. Opportunities for self-learning and peer learning significantly improve, reducing the value of official degrees and diplomas.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Alex Gray, ”The 10 skills you need to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.

For example, Ford has announced it aims to bring the first fully autonomous shared vehicles (or taxis) to the market by the year 2021. To reach that goal, the company has doubled its personnel in its Silicon Valley R&amp;D team.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>This transformation of mobility saves urban space massively and it should already be considered in zoning, urban planning, architecture, etc. Some of our current parking spaces will turn into stops where we get on and off the autonomous vehicles.

Yet a supermarket without any sales personnel has not been possible until the recent advances in sensors, machine vision and deep learning algorithms.</p><p>Amazon Go has introduced ”Just walk out” technology, a shop without lines and check outs. A Beta store has been opened in Seattle. Amazon plans to develop the technology and open stores as they learn more. Before some critical posts emerged, there was a notion of opening 2000 automated stores, which Amazon quickly denied.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>According to Forbes, fully automated supermarket is a big job killer. In United States, 7.3 million people work as cashiers. Automation will radically change retail store employment, even if it is suited for only certain kinds of products where customer service is not required.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Rachel Metz, ”Amazon’s cashier-less Seattle grocery store is opening to the public”.

            "summary": "Several employees value free time more than rapid career development or a pay raise. Different kinds of work and lifestyle choices are often aimed to create a better work-life balance.\n",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Amidst hectic work life and permanent stress, many employees wish they had more free time. Leisure time and its benefits are often valued higher and more rewarding than what could be achieved merely by accumulating wealth. Many studies also support the higher evaluation of free time; people who appreciate time over money often feel happier than people who focus on wealth. Appreciation of free time can also be seen in the investments people make to improve its contents and quality. People make use of a variety of services, experiences, and hobbies that aim to take their minds off work and on enjoying free time. More and more people also give great value to increased time spent with family and close ones.</p><p>One reason for the higher appreciation of free time is the different kind of relationship younger generations have with work. For the Y generation, which has already entered work markets and executive positions, work-life balance is one of the most essential issues affecting job satisfaction. For them, job isn’t everything but free time provides a more important significance to their lives than for earlier generations. They desire flexible employment relationships that better enable balancing work with other parts of their lives. For example, the popularity of teleworking has increased, because many appreciate the smaller amount of time spent commuting and the greater freedom to enjoy free time without additional limitations caused by the location of the workplace. People also value flexible work times, because they provide an opportunity to reduce the restrictions caused by strict hours and enable a more adjustable scheduling of private life responsibilities and hobbies.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Organisations that wish to obtain a motivated and committed employee base need to increase investment into the meaningfulness and flexibility of work. In recruiting the most competent individuals, offering more individualised work solutions may prove far more successful than merely dishing out more money. New kinds of pressures and challenges regarding organising work arise for employers, who should start paying more and more attention to employees’ needs and wishes.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2017 - Winning over the next generation of leaders”.

Space will gradually transform into a service, which makes the user experience (UX) more critical than ever. Both the construction and real estate industry, as well as cities, will face diverse opportunities and challenges which demand immediate responses.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Thanks to digitalization of both real estate business and the real estates themselves, information, so far confined in silos, will become available for exploitation, as the real estate systems start to communicate with each other.&nbsp;For example, real estate maintenance expert can guide a person on the premises to perform a check-up, repair or some other operation. Meanwhile, both work and business will become less dependent on time and location, manifesting as rising utilization rate and overbooking, which have a direct impact on the demand and quality of the spaces.</p><p>In interactive and smart real estates and built environments of the future, devices (IoT), people, things, processes, wireless electricity transmission, and information recording and its Internet-based transfer, will most likely be combined. As digitalization, AR/VR, IoT and growing efficiency become united with another accelerating trend, namely under-utilization preventing sharing economy, the real estate business starts to develop towards a new hybrid between ownership and renting, for which the solutions of platform economy, e.g., Liquidspace, will provide highly versatile possibilities. New, adaptable, service-based models of space usage will emerge, which redefine the payer and what the payment is for, and who funds it all.</p><p>In the future, along with cities, single buildings will most likely become autonomous regarding their power supply and waste management, which means that the structure produces its own energy, stores the surplus to high voltage batteries and sells it to the public grid. Such energy solutions will most likely feature solar, wind and bioenergy, combined with storage batteries, but it is also likely, that the coming energy conservation model might be based on the possibilities of the hydrogen economy, i.e., on hydrogen fuel cells and metallic hydrogen. Additionally, it is conceivable that the real estates will start, through thermo- and piezoelectric generators, a large-scale utilization of the waste energy created by pressure, voltage and temperature differences.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>All fields related to construction and housing are in constant change, but the transformation has been exceptionally quick in the real estate business. Digitalization and automatization are introducing more effective services and cost reductions, but at the same time, they are rising the expectations consumers have for real estates and housing.</p><p>One example of the challenges facing construction and real estate business, as well as cities, are the reduced lengths of both employment, space, and service contracts. The change of spaces to services means to real estate providers that the user experience will become increasingly significant.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>\"Digital Real Estate with SAP\".

Currently, it transports passengers at speeds up to 430 km/h. In Japan, a Maglev train has reached a velocity exceeding 600 km/h in tests. Hyperloop capsules, which use air pressure, are vigorously developed and tested. Hyperloop aims to fully revolutionize travel by offering speeds up to 1300 km/h.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>The development and spread of new transport means are naturally slowed down by the huge investments they require as well as a variety of infrastructure and safety issues.

Efficient use of space combined with high productivity might start a new era in the history of agriculture and create a whole new industry of urban farming.</p><p>Through vertical farming, external risk factors like, for example, diseases and contamination, can almost be eliminated from the growth processes. Control over the growth circumstances, e.g., lighting and nutrients, makes it possible to have an abundant and nutrient-rich harvest. Also, because of a controlled environment, the resources used for farming can be utilized more efficiently. Vertical agriculture is divided into two branches: hydroponics and aeroponics. In hydroponics, plants are grown in water-containers with nutrient solutions, whereas in aeroponics the roots of plants are being sprayed with a water-nutrient solution.</p><p>Vertical farming has its problems also. Among other things, real-estate costs, lighting costs, and recycling of the used water are all challenges waiting to be solved.

The treatment will gradually become customer-centred and reliant on automation. Nursing staff will take the role of a sparring partner, coach, and supporter. At the same time, the augmentation of the capabilities of the human body through technological and electrical attachments starts becoming feasible. This will cause a significant ethical discussion and possibly later a grouping of people into organic-humans, who perceive the body as “sacred,” and techno-humans, who treat the body as a user interface.",

            "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been labelled the fourth industrial revolution, and it perhaps might be the most significant one so far. This revolution is based on smart, connected products. This is made possible by rapid advancements in processing power, software, sensors, data storage, microprocessors, and wireless connectivity. According to an estimate by a multinational technology conglomerate Cisco, there will be 50 billion connected objects (things) by 2020 which equates to 6 connected items per person on earth.\n",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>To put IoT things into perspective, \"Industry 1.0\" started in the 1780's and was driven by mechanisation and steam power. \"Industry 2.0\" started around 1870 and was driven by the introduction of mass production techniques and electrical power. It was then followed by \"Industry 3.0\" in the late 1960's, which was driven by automation and electronics. We have now already entered Industry 4.0, which is characterised by cyber-physical systems, networks, and IoT. With pervasive connectivity, coupled with fast developments in artificial intelligence, both technical and cultural evolution are likely to become even more interesting going forward.</p><p>In monetary terms, B2B spending on IoT technologies, applications, and solutions is expected to reach €250 billion by 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, The Boston Consulting Group predicts that revenue from all layers of the IoT technology stack (software, connectivity, cloud, apps) will have at least a 20% compound annual growth rate.</p><p>By 2020, 50% of IoT spending will likely be driven by discrete manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and utilities. Predictive maintenance, self-optimising production, and automated inventory management are the top three use cases driving IoT market growth through to 2020.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>IoT will lead to systemic change that will requires new mindsets and a higher agility within organizations. In business terms, both value creation and value capture will be different. For example, not only current but also emergent customer needs must be addressed in real time and in a proactive way.</p><p>Going forward, it might no longer enough to develop, make, and sell standalone products that become obsolete with time. People and businesses expect product refreshes through over-the-air updates, with minimal disruption and hassle. This will continue the push for organizations to pursue a recurring revenue model instead of (or in addition to) point transactions.</p><p>The increasing capabilities of smart, connected products is expanding and reshaping industry boundaries. This interconnectedness will demand that companies understand and manage their industry and business processes on a high-level. It might become increasingly important to zoom out and understand other players' businesses and priorities in the marketspace to find and exploit complementary partnerships.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Michael Porter &amp; James Heppelmann, ”How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Competition”.

However, this does not guarantee that the purchase is made in the store, even if the service is professional and well-liked. More and more people end up ordering the product online from a different vendor, who is capable of delivering a cheaper price or a wider variety of, for example, size or colour choices.</p><p>This is why many known brands have already begun transforming their stores more to showrooms where the traditional sales-purchase exchange is augmented by combining the best sides of physical and digital service channels (omnishopping), offering the customer the best possible shopping experience.

            "summary": "A social ranking system refers to a register, in which each customer or citizen has their own balance of points, which changes in real time based, for example, on their purchasing behaviour or adherence to laws. As the first country in the world, China is introducing a social ranking system to monitor its citizens. Similar, state-run ranking systems or a voluntary, business owned systems, may also be proposed in the west.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>The Chinese government is planning to launch the Social Credit Score (SCS) system by 2020. In practice, they are trying to build a system that uses a large variety of data, such as financial, legal, and social information, to produce algorithm-based citizen scores of trustworthiness. As a result, an all-compassing social ranking system is established. The system will most likely be connected to the facial recognition system covering the entire country, which makes it impossible to move through a public space without being recognised.</p><p>The Chinese government rolled out the first plans of the SCS in 2014 and voluntary implementation has already started. Development has begun with the co-operation of eight private companies. It will be mandatory for all residents, legal persons (including companies), and other entities by 2020.</p><p>These partner companies include data giants like Sesame Credit and China Rapid Finance who have access to large quantities of diverse data. For instance, Sesame Credit’s SCS system rates people according five factors: credit history, obligation fulfilment capacity, personal characteristics, behaviour and preferences, and interpersonal relationships. As a result, an individual will be given a citizen score between 350 and 950 points.</p><p>The system is designed to reward well-rated individuals by giving them access to better and cheaper services, financing, premium leisure services, and education options for their children. In turn, the list of suggested penalties for those with lower scores ranges from lost access to social security benefits and stricter customs checks to withholding train or plane tickets or passports. Individuals with low scores will also not be able to hold a public office or some senior-level positions.</p><p>Ranking systems are gaining a foothold in the west also, at least in small scale. The sharing economy platforms try to build trust between the user and the provider through transparent evaluation and ranking. For example, Airbnb and Uber are utilising a ranking system in their service, in which the customer can, for instance, rate the service with one to five stars. Based on ratings, the Uber drivers or the Airbnb landlords can be punished, or they can be excluded from the service altogether. In a similar vein, a customer that have received bad ratings from their drivers or landlords may find it more difficult to obtain service in the future.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>The Chinese government has stated that the main goal of the system is to create a culture of sincerity and enhance the whole society's credibility. By implementing this type of system, China hopes to strengthen its economy and financial sector.</p><p>China’s plan has spurred a global discussion and been subject to wide-spread criticism. It is feared that it might lead towards a Big Brother world, as described in George Orwell’s dystopian novel \"1984\", or a future world in which people’s lives are dominated by social ratings as portrayed in Black Mirror's episode \"Nosedive\".</p><p>There are also supporting arguments backing up the developments of these kinds of systems. Those in favour argue that if done right, there could be significant benefits in terms of building trust and transparency in societies. The culture of continuous monitoring and rating is growing, and it’s possible that similar social ranking systems could gain wider popularity and acceptance all over the world.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Tara Francis Chan, “China’s social credit system has blocked people form taking 11 million flights and 4 million train trips”.

Working has generally been considered a respectful undertaking and a responsibility for those in the working age. Work motivation has not only been driven by the need to earn an income, but it has also been seen as an important venue for self expression and a means to create a purpose for life. However, the traditional work ethos is changing as new kinds of values and attitudes emerge. Concrete examples of this are well performing employees and entrepreneurs young adults who openly state they aim to retire in their 30s or early 40s.</p><p>These young people attempt to reach their goals through moderate consumption, unlevered possessions, savings, and investments. They are motivated by the freedom to use their time to things they regard important, which economic independence can offer even if it means living constantly on a tight budget. Work or employment are not central parts of their identity and they do not view continuous accumulation of wealth or updating of material possessions as key factors of happiness.</p><p>Even though all of these young adults do not completely rule out the possibility of working at some point in the future, their primary desire is to be able to make choices without compelling economic restraints. Some of the young who have been in the public eye have already realised their dream and have openly documented their story online, providing concrete hints for their followers who wish to achieve the same goal.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Anna Bahney, \"She retired at 28 with $2.25 million\".

            "summary": "Estimations of how much of contemporary human work could be fully automated in the next few decades vary from five to 70 per cent. Just as great variation can be found in estimations of how much new work appears as a result. In the most likely future, automation and human labour form increasingly efficient teams and jobs are lost at an increasing pace and new usages for human labour are found.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Automation and robotics have significantly transformed manufacturing already for decades. While there are recent advances in robotics, a more radical shift has taken place in algorithms that can take over knowledge work and the processes of monitoring automated production. In some cases this translates into loss of jobs, but generally speaking work is changing towards cooperation with robots and automated software.</p><p>A study by US management consulting firm McKinsey estimates that the financial benefit in implementing further automation in the industry may yield three to ten times the cost. It also notes that if machine learning can produce natural language perception and production at median human level, a further 13 percent of current work tasks can be automated in the US. Further, the study confirms that tacit knowledge and experience are immune to automation.</p><p>Examples of automated processes with robots and artificial intelligence include Kiva by Amazon: robots that act with other robots to plan how they should carry out their tasks at warehouses. The McKinsey study, which holds a modest estimation of technological unemployment, suggests that only 5 percent of current jobs could be replaced by automation, while up to 30 percent of tasks done by 60% of workforce could be automated. If this is the case, instead of disintegrating human jobs entirely, robots and automation will become our workmates, which, in turn, drastically changes the nature of work and the way teams operate.</p><p>The McKinsey study sees adding value to human labour: “As roles and processes get redefined, the economic benefits of automation will extend far beyond labour savings. Particularly in the highest-paid occupations, machines can augment human capabilities to a high degree, and amplify the value of expertise by increasing an individual’s work capacity and freeing the employee to focus on work of higher value.”</p><p>The study also paid attention to specific areas of human activities that are difficult to automate. Only 4 percent of US jobs were found to require creativity, and 29 percent to require a sense of human emotions. “While these findings might be lamented as reflecting the impoverished nature of our work lives, they also suggest the potential to generate a greater amount of meaningful work. This could occur as automation replaces more routine or repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus more on tasks that utilize creativity and emotion.”</p><p>Bolder estimates state that better utilisation of automation based on already existing machinery and software could replace up to 45-47 % of current work. If this holds water, the potential of rapid technological development to replace human work could mean far greater technological unemployment.</p><p>Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne studied the impact of machine learning and mobile robotics on 702 different occupations. According to them, “… algorithms for big data are now rapidly entering domains reliant upon pattern recognition and can readily substitute for labour in a wide range of non-routine cognitive tasks”. While knowledge workers at large will be impacted by future automation, Benedikt and Osborne assert that, “most workers in transportation and logistics occupations, together with the bulk of office and administrative support workers, and labour in production occupations, are at risk.”</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Automation is likely to transform existing jobs by removing routine tasks, speeding up and adding quality to some tasks, and creating more space for creativity and insight in jobs assisted by AI software. There are several physical jobs that automation and robotics will replace, leading to technological unemployment, but also those that it will not be able to replace. It seems that while routine jobs are lost, they are replaced by more complex jobs that require creative ideation and a human interaction.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Louise Lucas, ”Alibaba and Microsoft AI beat humans in Stanford reading test”.

            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>The global growth of real estate markets is driven by three strong megatrends. Firstly, urbanisation is intensifying: estimates state that up to 75 % of the global population will live in urban areas by the year 2050. The number of megacities (with more than 10 million inhabitants) is expected to be 37 in 2025. Secondly, world population continues to grow and will reach its peak of ca. 9.3 billion around the year 2050. Thirdly, the amount of capital available for investment is continuously growing and concentrating to fewer and fewer hands. Furthermore, in the increasingly uncertain world, safe investment targets that yield adequate returns are few and far between.</p><p>In fact, the rapidly growing housing markets are still considered one of the most secure investments – especially amongst the middle classes. In China, this development has led to the construction of ghost cities and a serious threat of a real estate bubble. Warnings about similar overheated markets and speculation problems have been raised all around the world.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>“Property markets”.

            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>This far, several tested robot cars have been automatised versions of existing models. In the future, the robot vehicles will likely not be confined to the present body styles and features.</p><p>One noteworthy direction toward which the passenger traffic is developing is the flying taxi concept, introduced by Audi, Airbus and Italdesign at 2018 Geneva Motor Show. In this design, robot platforms, which carry passenger cabins, operate on highways. Also if need be, a robot drone can transport a cabin from one platform to another. The cabin can also travel on a railway carriage, ship, in a vacuum tube, or on an aerial vehicle. Sturdier and more robust platforms will likely be developed for the truck traffic, and cabins holding multiple passengers might be introduced for mass transit. Either there will be a couple of different operating models, or then there will be platforms with adjustable size and ride height.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Travelling is becoming more and more a part of an active life. At their initial stage, the cabins might be standard models, but in the long run, probably dozens of different applications will be developed for them, and their features and appearances will vary greatly. The cabin can be used as a bedroom, movie theatre, kitchen, gym, cafe, bar, sauna, game room, workspace or a conference room. Customers can buy and customise their cabins any way they please or rent special-purpose cabins. The material the cabin is made of could either be glass, wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, or stone, and the cabin could resemble an old-fashioned car, sports car, space ship, container or almost anything else.</p><p>An economy worth of billions, comparable to the present automobile industry, will likely form around the cabins, and it will blur the boundaries between home, vehicle, vacation home, entertainment centre, workplace, and hotel. It is even possible that the cabins will become homes or offices for many people.</p><p>Also, new kinds of services, which are aimed at the time spent travelling in the cabin, such as virtual games, teaching, restaurant or wellness services or even brothels, could emerge.</p><p>The use of the cabins could also develop in such a way that the cabins meant for housing and short distance travel are a mix of various kinds of modules, whereas the long-distance travel cabins are airtight and durable pods, which have been constructed according to precise safety regulations.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”Audi, Italdesign and Airbus combine self-driving car and passenger drone”.

Although experts only predict 5G to become widely available in a couple of years, it is guaranteed to give us faster speeds and to become the driving technology behind the Internet of Things.</p><p>But even if it’s not clear how it will come about (one option is by tapping into millimetre waves), there are a few requirements that it should meet. These include: very low latency compared to LTE, the ability to have hundreds of thousands of connections for wireless sensors, improved coverage, and of course, extremely fast speeds, even when in very crowded areas like football stadiums or major events.</p><p>Currently, there aren’t really any well-defined standards for 5G and as a result, different companies and countries are taking different approaches. Furthermore, over 180 scientists and doctors from around the world have warned of the potential health impacts resulting from increased exposure to wireless radiation.

            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Companies like Google and Tesla compete to build autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads without driver input. This is no doubt a necessary step in the development towards traffic that is driverless.</p><p>It is highly likely that autonomous cars made by a myriad of companies could not be the basis of future traffic, or at least not without synchronisation of their decision-making algorithms. Imagine for example a conflict of interest situation between two autonomous cars about to collide. If they both make the same choice, yet cannot communicate with each other, they will either crash or stall.</p><p>Design theorist Anthony Dunne sees software based traffic system as a new kind of economy: <em>“It will be a bit like economy airlines. Once there is a technology that can control access to the roads as a limited resource, it will be used to maximize revenue in an extreme way with still some humaneness.”</em></p><p>Dunne foresees governments leasing road use rights to companies like Google or Amazon, who in turn divide the asset amongst consumers and companies. Depending on how much one pays, it gives more access (quantity of vehicles, seats or tonnes) or speed, where part of the traffic is slowed down while some sped up.</p><p>Traffic as software will enable reduction of traffic jams as companies and their employees can begin to manage arrival times to work and minimize time spent in traffic.</p><p>Toll roads with expensive collection systems are a forerunner of privatization of roads and traffic rights. Whether traffic in the future is based on individual moving vehicles or more collective units such as trains and buses or a hybrid of these as today, remains to be seen.</p><p>Given that cars are not driven by people with their emotional way of driving, software controlled vehicles can function in a software based traffic system seamlessly. Role of Artificial Intelligence, especially deep learning algorithms will be vital to create an adaptive system that learns about needs of both transported humans as well as transported goods.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Without co-coordinated software that provides a traffic system between autonomously moving vehicles, the entire industry could fail. It is likely that companies that now excel in software like Google will focus on software rather than vehicles themselves. Traffic as software will require major investments, legislative efforts and collaboration between companies developing cars and their support systems. Traffic as software can become a major new field of business.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Brandon Formby, ”New law clears the way for driverless cars on Texas roads”.

If 3D local production becomes more common, it will substantially reduce the need for storage and product transport, since the formulas that the equipment require are electronic, and the raw materials needed are mainly powders and liquids.&nbsp;</p><p>The third area that may launch a new era for logistics, even if airplanes and 3D printing were not successful, are supersonic vacuum tubes, of which the best-known are the Hyperloop and the Chinese state-developed flying train Hyperflight. In the planned supersonic vacuum tubes it could be possible to transport containers from a Chinese factory to, for example, a European city within a few hours.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>In the vision of Amazon, intermediate storage, middlemen, forklifts, trucks, ports, container ships, container cranes or containers are hardly needed anymore. In this scenario retail would also no longer have the role it currently has, storing and distributing goods. Basically, Amazon airships would be able to take care of all delivery of the goods for an entire city. However, there are still several challenges to this vision, such as creation of a traffic system for the urban airspace, new legislation, planning a safe follow-up for the goods delivered at the doorstep, and especially addressing the sizeable electricity consumption and the need to charge the batteries of the huge flock of drones.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>“Making deliveries with the DHL Parcelcopter 3.0”.

These spaces would monitor our bodily functions and analyse gathered data, compare data to our personal genetic map, and automatically diagnose what kind of action we should take.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>At first, spaces designed for monitoring and analysing human health as well as related mobile applications become more common. Next, available services will offer peer review and comparison of health data as well as crowdsourced services, automated diagnostics, and online consultations of international experts. Later, health services will also include augmented and virtual reality applications as well as health and nutrition scanners. All the aforementioned health-promoting services can be actualised through mobile means, regardless of location. Actual automated health spaces become a reality only when all monitoring, data analyses, AI consultation, and real-time data visualisation performed in a single location are combined with diagnosis-based treatment, including e.g. 3D-printing of medicines.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>The role of contemporary health clinics will significantly diminish. In the future people will mostly be able to find treatment in their local automated health space or through mobile tools and the availability of care personnel is often unnecessary. Only in more severe cases of disease or trauma are patients required to visit a doctor or a hospital.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”A Chinese AI passed the national medical licensing exam, so technically it’s a doctor”.

            "summary": "<p>Solar radiation management (SRM) refers to solutions to reduce the impact of climate change by reflecting a part of inbound sunlight back out into space. SRM techniques are only just being developed, but at best they could potentially greatly help to combat climate change, at least in the short term. In the long term, however, using SRM techniques could have unpredictable and even irreversible consequences for the Earth.</p>",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>A variety of different kind of SRM techniques have already been proposed. One of the solutions that have gained interest is to spread particulates or aluminium oxide into the upper atmosphere to reflect sunlight back to space. Another suggestion is to whiten clouds over oceans to increase their reflectivity. Any long-term effects of these methods – or any other SRM solutions – are not known and they are remarkably challenging to estimate.</p><p>It is worth noting that developing SRM techniques, let alone taking such into use, requires answering a wide range of open questions regarding, for instance, cause and effect, multiplier effects, subjects of research, and funding. Because any actions would have an impact on the entire atmosphere, the nation states would need to reach an agreement regarding which methods to use and who will carry out the plans.</p><p>The defenders of SRM view them as a potential emergency solution, to be used if other measures to combat climate change prove to be ineffective or they are carried out too late. In other words, even those who defend the SRM techniques only see them as a temporary solution mainly fit for providing some extra time to resolve the issues caused by climate change and help the humanity to transition towards a carbon-free economy.</p><p>The critics of SRM see the concept riddled with threats. They believe that global climate and ecosystem are so complex that any attempts to tamper with them could lead to unpredictable multiplier effects such as the ones that were seen in Australia when foxes and rabbits were introduced there, or worse. For instance, if aluminium oxide were released into the stratosphere to reflect the sunlight just before a supervolcano eruption, the use of nuclear weapons, a sudden stop of the Gulf Stream, or a large meteor hitting the Earth, it could lead to an environmental catastrophe even worse than climate change – and the SRM would have been a central cause of it.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”What is SRM?”.

            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Hyperlocalisation is one manifestation of a new kind of ethical and ecological ethos; the desire to grow one’s own food is related to willingness to recycle. New ideas include growing crops on roofs and in restaurants or offices. The DIY (do it yourself) culture as a whole is a sphere of hyperlocalisation, as are self-produced furniture (crafts, 3D printed own designs) or gardening. Hyperlocalisation also includes local or self-produced news content.</p><p>Amidst all the pressure from market forces and strong multinational conglomerates, hyperlocalisation offers an alternative perspective, a softer and more local alternative for fulfilling basic needs and desires. On one hand, it deals with making things oneself, but it also deals with ideas of sharing, participating, and community building, which aims to support individuals’ and communities’ goals and wellbeing.</p><p>The underlying values often deal with economic, ecological, social, and cultural sustainability. Hyperlocalisation can just as well deal with traditional knowledge and skills as with utilising new technologies and research results, which enable improved opportunities for local production and sharing.</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>Hyperlocalisation also means that some people who used to be mere consumers now also become producers. Instead of consuming ready-made products, they can now be served with raw materials as well as products and services that enable or improve local production.</p><p>Alongside creating products and services themselves, people also give priority to locally produced goods. A growing demand for hyperlocal alternatives in a given field means that existing businesses must take these desires into account and answer to this call. If existing companies miss this opportunity, it is likely that new entrepreneurs or customers themselves start to build networks that enable the production and dissemination of hyperlocally produced goods entirely bypassing old channels and stakeholders.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>Andy Williams, ”Hyperlocal News in the UK: Its Current State and Future Prospects”. <a href=\"http://impress.press/news/hyperlocal-news-in-the-uk.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://impress.press/news/hyperlocal-news-in-the-uk.html</a></li><li>”Hyper-Local Restaurants: Growing Produce in Your Own Backyard”. <a href=\"http://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/780/hyper-local-restaurants-growing-produce-in-your-own-backyard.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/780/hyper-local-restaurants-growing-produce-in-your-own-backyard.html</a></li><li>Kimberley Mok, ”Brooklyn Microgrid: A Blockchain-based Platform for Locally Traded Electricity”.

            "summary": "The design culture regarding business and service spaces has long concentrated on technical and economic issues and hardly any attention has been paid to the design atmospheres. In the near future, the atmosphere offered for the customer and comprehensive brand experiences rise to key roles in customers’ product and service consumption.",
            "body": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Future business and service locations will be able to offer a variety of moods and atmospheres that can be tailored, modified, and adjusted according to users’ needs and wishes or the context of use in real time or modified based on a pre-determined logic with the help of changing audio, olfactory, lighting, colour, and image schemes. Comprehensive experiences are created through atmospheres that serve all senses and offer a variety of sensations.</p><p>Atmospheres cannot be created merely by creating passive multi-sensory spaces, services, or brands, but by promoting customers’ active interaction with the business or service space and by allowing them to control the space via voices, gestures, touches, or motion.</p><p>Examples of atmosphere design could include a waiting room with a predefined set of atmospheric choices, which customers can vote on or an apartment hotel for seniors, where all spaces and services have been designed to be game-like and to have positive health impacts.</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>Business and service spaces need to offer increasingly comprehensive purchasing and service experiences in order to provide customers with unique new value. A good atmosphere improves customer satisfaction and creates returning customers who have received quality service and have been regarded as individuals. Atmosphere design is of particular importance to businesses who compete with online shopping or companies whose services can in the future be conducted by the customers themselves at home.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”Glimpse the Store of the Future”.

At the moment it is unclear, however, how large a portion of the asteroids reachable to humans may contain something worth mining and how those resources could be transported back to Earth.</p><p>According to some views, minerals mined in space should not be shipped back to Earth at all but rather be used to construct space-based telecommunication infrastructure and other facilities. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the first resource to be exploited should not be minerals but water, which could be turned into rocket fuel to replenish the engines.</p><h2>Impacts</h2><p>Due to lack of international legislation, asteroid mining is feared to become the new gold rush. In the present political climate, in which international treaties do not enjoy widespread adherence, no great mutual understanding is likely to be achieved in the coming years.</p><p>If asteroid mining takes off in the coming decades, it will likely have a notable impact on both the global economy and the political environment. Suddenly, some raw materials may be available in unlimited quantities, which would be reflected in their prices as well as tax revenues of the nations that produce them. In turn, the nations first to tap into the riches of space may come to possess technological and material advantages not just here on Earth but also when it comes to the conquest of space.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>“Asteroid mining news”.

In addition, unlike cotton, it does not require valuable agricultural land or need large-scale watering.&nbsp;</p><p>Further investments in research and manufacturing are required before wood-based textiles can be taken into wider use. If the current trend towards more environmentally sustainable materials continues, however, it will be the forests that produce the majority of materials needed for the clothing industry, not the cotton fields. Ethical consumers will play a central role in bringing wood-based clothes to the mainstream.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><ul><li>”Cellulose-based fibres will open a new future for Finnish textile industry”.

New conflicts may break out in the Middle-East and Africa, which could result in several new failed states. If there will a be a new global economic crisis, and at the same time the EU would face a renewed wave of millions of refugees, the entire EU, and especially the Eurozone, might, following the example of Brexit, fall apart. This development could also lead to the disintegration of Russia, which probably would not happen peacefully. However, it is somewhat more likely that the emerging crises can be managed, at least to some extent.</p>",
